# Q+A
Q. Why Java?
A. The programs that we are writing are very similar to their counterparts in several other languages, 
   so our choice of language is not crucial. We use Java because it is widely available, 
   embraces a full set of modern abstractions, and has a variety of automatic checks for mistakes in programs, 
   so it is suitable for learning to program. 
   
   There is no perfect language, and you certainly will be programming in other languages in the future.

Q. Do I really have to type in the programs in the book to try them out?
A. Everyone should type in HelloWorld.java, but you can find all of the code in this book (and much more) on this booksite.

Q. What are Java's rules regarding tabs, spaces and newline characters?
A. There are not many. Java compilers treat them all to be equivalent. For example, we could also write HelloWorld as follows:
public class HelloWorld { public static void main ( 
String [] args) { System.out.println("Hello World") ; } }
